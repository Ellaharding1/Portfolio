                <h3>Unity Game: Rescue Royale</h3>
                <p>This game was developed in collaboration with a team of four others, where I took a leadership role to ensure effective collaboration and smooth project execution. Unity was used for immersive 3D environments and dynamic gameplay, with Blender for 3D modeling, and Visual Studio and C# for coding game logic. I coordinated the team's efforts in using Photoshop and Audacity for texture creation and sound design, resulting in a polished and engaging player experience.</p>

                <h3>Website: FloraFuze</h3>
                <p>FloraFuze.com is a website I developed to showcase and sell handcrafted glass flower art. Built using HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript, the site offers a user-friendly interface and a responsive design, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across all devices. I managed the entire project, from design to deployment, focusing on creating an engaging online presence for the unique glass art pieces.</p>

                <h3>Java Program: Algorithms</h3>
                <p>In this project, I developed a Java program to implement and compare various sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bucket Sort. The program measures and outputs the execution time for each algorithm, allowing for a detailed performance analysis across different sorting methods. This project highlights my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and my ability to apply Java programming to solve computational problems effectively.</p>

                <p>I designed and developed a comprehensive portfolio website to showcase my diverse range of skills and projects. This dynamic site features a clean, modern design and is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices. The portfolio integrates interactive elements and visual assets, including custom graphics and project descriptions, to effectively communicate my expertise in web development, game design, and software engineering.</p>
