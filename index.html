                    <h3>Unity Game: Princess Quest</h3>
                    <p>This project involved developing an adventure video game called "Princess Quest" using Unity and C++. In this game, players guide a princess through three challenging levels to rescue her prince. The project featured dynamic enemy behavior, weapon upgrades, and immersive environments. Our team incorporated 3D modeling using Blender, added rich audio experiences through custom sound effects, and built game logic to ensure seamless gameplay. My role included creating core game mechanics, integrating assets, and refining the user experience.</p>
